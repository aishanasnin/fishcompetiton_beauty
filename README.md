Project Description
"Welcome to Fishnova — the ultimate stage where beauty meets the deep blue! From shimmering scales to elegant fin flicks, our aquatic stars will dazzle the judges and make waves in the world of underwater glamour. In this fin-tastic showcase, each contestant swims for the crown, proving that in the ocean of style, only the brightest stars… and fish… shine!"

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have been hosting beauty competitions for humans, cats, and even pumpkins — but no platform exists to celebrate our scaly friends’ elegance.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a smart fish judging app that evaluates fish based on scale patterns, symmetry, and visual appeal using computer vision and machine learning.  
Because why not give fish the recognition they deserve?
